# toolkitJava
478 toolkit in Java

## Build Instructions for Linux:

* Clone the repo by downloading from the website, or running the command:
 
    ```git clone https://github.com/cs478ta/toolkitJava.git```
* Navigate to the folder and run: ```javac *.java```

* (Optional) See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNC5eIJygl8 for a screencast on how to setup the toolkit in Eclipse

(We do not use Windows, but there is nothing fancy and I imagine that it should work in Microsoft Visual C++. You will need to create a project solution. If you use Windows and have trouble, come see us for help.)
